    "# Credit Card Fraud Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenerio, a credit card company is determining what kind of customers they have that are being targeted by frauds and scams. In this exercise, we are going to explore the data for any potential patterns try and identify which customers are the most likely to be targeted, which kinds of customers drive the largest amount and most frequent amounts of fraud, and any other pertinent information that may exist. Our ultimate goal is to identify this so we can take precautions and build solutions so we can reduce the likelihood of the customers to become victims of fraud in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "A new credit card company has just entered the U.S. market. They are trying to identifyinstances of fraud. In the internal data, we have raw transaction data with instances of fraud that have been flagged internally, by customers who have called in to customer support \n",
    "\n",
    "The executive wants to know how accurately you can predict fraud using this data. She has stressed that the model should err on the side of caution: it is not a big problem to flag transactions as fraudulent when they aren't just to be safe. In your report, you will need to describe how well your model functions and how it adheres to these criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It will need to outline your \n",

    "What types of purchases are most likely to be instances of fraud?\n",
    "\n",
    "What types of customers are most likely to be instances of fraud?\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the fraud rates across the US? What are they across different states?\n",
    "\n",
    "Are the targets of these predominately in rural areas? Urban? Suburban?\n",
    "\n",
    "Are older customers more likely to be victims of credit card fraud? Does it make a difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "Are the consistencies amongst the merchants for these fraudulent transactions to occur?\n",

    "- I noticed that there were longitudal and latitudal information for the merchant, but not the city or state. That makes it a little difficult to see if proximity to the physical store had any relation to if the customer were scammed for the fraudulent transaction or not. Maybe if they were closer to the store, and it was familiair or somewhere they drove by often it was more likely to occur, the customer could more easily be tricked?\n",
    "\n",
    "- After going through the data a little more granulrly, it made sense to look for general US population data, broken down by town to help map out the vendor's location and see if that made any difference as to why individuals were being targeted, or why the specific merchants were being targeted. This step was to be conducted <b>after</b> an initial analysis based on solely the initial dataset.\n",
